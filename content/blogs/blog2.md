I had numerous internships during high school and my undergraduate studies. I started my working experience as an intern in an accounting and audit company in Paris. 
During my first year of undergraduate studies, I interned for 6 months in the headquarters of the bank BRED in Paris. Three years later, I briefly interned in Beijing Huijin Fengsheng Investment Management company in Beijing. This internship has been terminated in advance because of the coronavirus outbreak, but, I remained resilient and positive. I found an internship in an accounting and consulting company in Paris: Fexcom Conseil. 

At the height of the global pandemic, I found a full-time position as a fund accountant specialised in private equity, real estate, securities, in Caceis, Luxembourg. My experience at Caceis enabled me to develop my communication skills by being in daily contact with clients -  fund managers for the closing of the accounting period. I also developed my team-work skills since I collaborated with teams accross the firm, such a investor services and middle office.

Since January 2021, I am a working part-time as a consultant in the Moroccan investment fund MDM Caps. This position helped me to develop my analytical skills: I perform financial modelling and forecast, solvency, profitability analyses.
