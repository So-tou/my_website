I had numerous internships during high school and my undergraduate studies. I started my working experience as an intern in an accounting and audit company in Paris. 
During my first year of undergraduate studies, I interned for 6 months in the headquarters of the bank BRED in Paris. Three years later, I briefly interned in Beijing Huijin Fengsheng Investment Management company in Beijing. This internship has been terminated in advance because of the coronavirus outbreak, but, I remained resilient and positive. I found an internship in an accounting and consulting company in Paris: Fexcom Conseil. At the height of the global pandemic, I found a full-time position as a fund accountant specialised in private equity, real estate, securities, in Caceis, Luxembourg.
