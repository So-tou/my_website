I am currenlty the VP of the LBS Middle East Club. The Middle East Club is an assoication helping LBS students to learn more about Middle East and to help them to build a working experience in Middle East. I am an active member of the REFM since 2012. REFM is a network that aims to develop French and North-African accounting relationship. This network also helps newly accountants and chartered accountants to find professional opportunities.  When I joined LBS, I participate in the away day where we fixed a children's park and we planted flowers.
