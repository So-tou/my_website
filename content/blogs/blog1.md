I am studying the Masters in Financial Analysis programme at London Business School. In this prestigious school, in the heart of London, I have the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in Finance, to have working opportunities, and to study my favourite course, which is Data Analytics, taught by the best teacher !


After high school, I decide to study a dual bachelor degree in International Management and in Business Administrations. I studied two years at NEOMA Business School, in France and I studied in the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, China. In the University of International Business and Economics, all the programme was taught in Mandarin. Thanks to this dual degree, I have a French diploma and Chinese diploma.
